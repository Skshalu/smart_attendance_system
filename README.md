#Setting up the project
To initiaaalize the project you can use npm to initialize the project using the command "npm i".

#To locally host the project you need to start
1. The backend server using "npx nodemon server.js"
2.  frontend using "npm start".
Try to do these commands on different terminals( I use VSCode so doing it on two terminals is easy ).
Keep in mind that for backend your path location should be in the server folder and for front it needs to be in the root folder.

#Nodemon is already setup so any changes in the server will reflect automaticaly without it needing to be explicitly rerun.

#Please dont make changes directly in the main branch.
